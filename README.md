FINE 3300 (Fall 2025): Assignment #1 - Mortgage and Exchange Rates

### Overview
There are two components to this assignment:
- The first part is a Mortgage Payments class which is used to calculate the monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, rapid bi-weekly, weekly, and rapid weekly payment amounts based on user input of the principal, quoted interest rate, and amortization period.

- The second part of the assignment is to create an Exchange Rates class that will read a file containing currency exchange rate data and use the most recent USD/CAD rate to convert between the two currencies based on user input of the amount, base currency, and target currency.

### Usage
1. Make sure the exchange rate CSV file `BankOfCanadaExchangeRates.csv` is located in the project directory.
2. Run `Main.py` and follow the prompts for user input.
3. Input the mortgage principal amount, interest rate, and amortization period. The results will be displayed in the terminal.
4. Input the amount to be converted, followed by the base currency and the target currency. The results will again be displayed in the terminal.
